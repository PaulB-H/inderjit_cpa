<h3 class="projectHeader">IBansal CPA</h3>

<p class="projectDesc">
  A minimal page made for an accountant. Secured with SSL through
  CertBot / LetsEncrypt, and hosted on a Ubuntu VPS with NGINX. I also
  setup some basic server security such as restricting root access
  over SSH, and implementing an auto-IP banning service to stop brute
  force access attempts.

<p class="projectDesc">
  I wanted to lock this to scroll section by section. I applied spans
  with the rule "white-space: nowrap" to make sure things like email
  and phone number did not line-break in an awkward spot. I used a
  library called Animate on Scroll to make the page feel more dynamic.
